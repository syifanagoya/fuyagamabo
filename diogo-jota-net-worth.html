He went on to make his first Primeira Liga appearance in early 2015 as a substitute for Diogo Rosado in a 2-2 home tie with Vit√≥ria de GuimarƒÅes. A few months later, Jota signed a new five-year contract with Pa√ßos.</p><h2 id=atletico-madrid-fc-porto><strong>Atl√©tico Madrid and FC Porto</strong></h2><p>In March of 2016, Jota signed a five-year contract with the La Liga club Atl√©tico Madrid.

With the club, he scored his first goal in a 3-2 victory over Hull City. In early 2018, it was reported that Jota had made a deal to remain with Wolverhampton.

Jota subsequently made his debut in the English top division in a 2-2 home tie with Everton. In late 2018, he recorded his first competition goal in a 2-1 win over Chelsea. A little over a month later, in early 2019, Jota notched his second career hat-trick in a 4-3 win over Leicester City. He recorded another major accomplishment a couple months later with his winning goal against Manchester United in the FA Cup; in the process, the Wolves advanced to their first semifinal in that competition since 1997-98.</p><p>The 2019-20 season was Jota's final with the Wolves. In July, he helped the club win over the Crusaders in the Europa League second qualifying round; this was the Wolves' first European goal since 1980. The Wolves ultimately reached the final Europa League group stage, during which Jota came on as a substitute and completed a hat-trick to give his team the win. He scored another hat-trick in the first leg of the tournament's last 32. Jota made his final Wolves appearance as a second-half substitute in the Europa League quarterfinal against Sevilla.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-331559 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Diogo-Jota.jpg alt="Diogo Jota Net Worth" width=900 height=623 sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-331559 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by Clive Brunskill/Getty Images)</p><h2 id=liverpool><strong>Liverpool</strong></h2><p>In September of 2020, Jota signed to Liverpool.
