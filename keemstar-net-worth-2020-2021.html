Back then, he was known as DJ Keemstar.</p><p>Keemstar did not start his online career as a well-planned and already thought of an idea. His career started as a hobby where he would post about Twitter feuds between YouTubers. His posts would have the hashtag, #DramaAlert. Fans loved what he did, and he quickly became popular. He uploaded a video of one of his posts, and that was when his YouTube career took shape.</p><p>He officially launched the YouTube channel as NewDramaAlert on June 15, 2014. Over 300,000 people subscribed to his channel within its first year after its launch. Despite the popularity of the channel, the channel was also heavily criticized for posting controversial content.</p><p>He was accused of being a racist after he called a moderator, Alex, on Battlecam.com, a nigger. This later became a meme, and some people even made compilation videos of him. In 2016, YouTube also came under heavy criticism for live streaming underage girls who appear half-naked. Although the videos in question date back to 2010, the issue still caused a stir. He had to step down as host of the show for a week to allow issues to cool down.</p><p>2016 was not a good year for the YouTuber as the issues keep piling up. Keemstar got himself into another problem when he posted a video talking about how he cannot wait to report on the death of TotalBiscuit. TotalBiscuit had initially revealed that he had terminal cancer. He later apologized to TotalBiscuit, but the harm had already been done. Even though he deleted the video, people were quick to make copies before he decided to delete it.</p><p>Even though Keemstar had been initially banned for owning a YouTube channel, he found out in 2016 that he now had access to the account. Keemstar’s channel reached one million subscribers in February 2016. In July 2017, the number of subscribers increased to 2 million.
