His punishment was a thirty days jail sentence and a further five years probation. His death in 2012 ended a rather miserable existence but his unique personality has always meant that he remains a subject of interest. Here is everything we know about him.</p><h3><strong>Summary of Brian Peppers’ Bio</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Full name:</strong> Brian Joseph Peppers</li><li><strong>Gender:</strong> Male</li><li><strong>Date of birth:</strong> November 1, 1968</li><li><strong>Place of birth:</strong> Toledo, Ohio, United States</li><li><strong>Date of death:</strong> February 7, 2012</li><li><strong>Place of death:</strong> Toledo, Ohio, United States</li><li><strong>Brian Peppers’ Age at the time of death:</strong> 43 years old</li><li><strong>Ethnicity:</strong> Caucasian</li><li><strong>Nationality:</strong> American</li><li><strong>Zodiac Sign:</strong> Scorpio</li><li><strong>Sexual Orientation:</strong> Straight</li><li><strong>Religion:</strong> Christianity</li><li><strong>Marital Status:</strong> Single</li><li><strong>Brian Peppers’ Parents:</strong> Bert Mahlon Peppers (father), Joyce C.

His birth sign was Scorpio and he belonged to the Caucasian race. His birth in the United States gave him access to all the rights, privileges, and responsibilities of an American citizen.</p><p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/heightline.com/wp-content/uploads/BeFunky-collage-1-1.jpg alt="Brian Peppers" width=696 height=464 sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Not much information is available on members of his birth family but we can confirm that he was the son of a man named Bert Mahlon Peppers while his mother is a woman named Joyce C. Egger. Giving birth to Brian was the only contribution his parents made to his life as several sources have confirmed that they abandoned him at birth at the doorstep of an unknown woman.</p><p>Thankfully, she took him in and raised him as her own. She even sought to get him a suitable formal education. Going to school, however, was a miserable experience for Brian who was forced to bear the brunt of ridicule and abuse from virtually all his classmates who bullied him incessantly, primarily because of his physical deformity which was precipitated by his health condition.</p><h2><strong>He Was Born With Crouzon Syndrome</strong></h2><p>Brian Peppers was born with a condition known as Crouzon Syndrome, or Apert Syndrome to some others. As previously indicated, Brian’s schoolmates picked on him viciously because of how he looked, and his physical appearance was primarily down to the effects of the condition he was born with.</p><p>Croydon Syndrome is characterized by the premature fusion of certain skull bones, which in turn prevents the skull from growing the right way. It often manifests itself in the person’s physical and facial appearance. In full bloom, it leads to protruding eyes and deformed facial features, and all these symptoms were evident in Brian Peppers’ appearance.</p><p><a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/heightline.com/wp-content/uploads/Brian-Peppers-1.jpg alt width=696 height=393 sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Beyond the facial anomaly, the health condition also affected Brian’s skin which was blighted with several skin issues and stunted his physical growth which eventually led to him not growing beyond 4 ft. 1 inch (124 cm) and not weighing more than 45 kg (100 lbs.).</p><p>Brian’s problems did not end after leaving school as he faced the same stigma and challenges he was forced to deal with in school, in the general public. Inevitably, that level of discrimination from the unfeeling public led to a mental breakdown which also led to the formation of several terrible habits on the part of Brian.</p><p>He became violent and sought to satisfy his raging sexual desires by masturbating in public spaces, teasing women wantonly, and molesting barnyard animals. Things got worse for the Toledo native as he grew older. He could barely do anything for himself and was subsequently placed in a nursing home during the late 1990s.</p><h2><strong>Brian Peppers Was A Convicted Sex Offender</strong></h2><p>Brian’s bad habits came to a head and put him in trouble in 1998 when he was charged with gross sexual imposition on one of the nurses attending him. The identity of the nurse in question, who alleged that he molested her and tore her clothes forcefully, has remained hidden from the media and the public but Brian paid the price for his actions as he was convicted and sentenced to thirty days in jail and a further five years probation.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/heightline.com/wp-content/uploads/9366c3fb244d17ef.jpg alt="Brian Peppers" width=696 height=464 sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>On completion of his thirty days jail sentence, Brian was required to register as a sex offender in the state of Ohio. His situation continued to worsen even after the dust his actions raised had settled, especially in 2005 when the infamous internet meme website YMTD started linking his pictures to posts regarding improper sexual conduct.</p><p>It led to several people making even more fun of the sexual offender and even photoshopping his face on merch designed to dissuade people from engaging in any form of sexual misconduct. The grotesque condition of his face often led people who did not know of his existence to wondering if there was a real-life Brian Peppers.</p><p>To confirm his existence, the fact-checking site, Snopes embarked on a fact-finding mission that included contacting the Ohio Attorney General’s office as well as obtaining school photos of the sexual offender from his classmate. Those photos reasserted the confirmation of Brian’s existence that the site had received from the Attorney General’s office.</p><h2><strong>Brian Peppers Died At The Age Of 43</strong></h2><p>Brian Peppers died on February 7, 2012, at the age of 43 years old. Several reliable sources have confirmed the cause of his death as excessive alcohol consumption. He had taken to drinking as one of the ways to alleviate his miserable existence.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/heightline.com/wp-content/uploads/brian-peppers-e1518730592114-1024x576.jpg alt width=696 height=392 sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>In the end, it became the motivating factor that led to his death even though he had momentarily stopped drinking during his time in prison. Details of Brian Peppers’ last days on earth are quite grainy but it is believed that he lived out the rest of his days in a wheelchair at a nursing home in his home state of Ohio.</p><p>Brian Peppers was buried at Ottawa Hills Memorial Park, in Lucas County, Toledo, Ohio, United States. His existence, though unpalatable, further exposes the rottenness of human nature given the level of ridicule and disdain he was forced to endure.</p><p>We cannot help but think that if someone had shown Brian the least bit of love, care, attention, and consideration; generally basic human decency, things would have turned out differently and he might still be alive and productive to society today. But hey, that’s just an opinion.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZ60qcDLoqWeZpOkunCu0aKYp2Wgmr2xsdGsZKWhlpp6pbHArZ9mmZ6ZeqSt1KycZqeWYrGmrdOhZg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbrian-peppers-life-death-and-cause-of-death.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbrian-peppers-life-death-and-cause-of-death.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbrian-peppers-life-death-and-cause-of-death.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbrian-peppers-life-death-and-cause-of-death.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbrian-peppers-life-death-and-cause-of-death.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbrian-peppers-life-death-and-cause-of-death.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./what-are-the-three-signs-of-the-holy-spirit-at-pentecost.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./what-are-the-three-signs-of-the-holy-spirit-at-pentecost.html>What are the three signs of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./zoey-deutch-chanel-tribeca-dinner-bra-top-tweed-suit-7511458.html>Zoey Deutch Just Chanel-ified the Bra Top Trend</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./zoey-deutch-chanel-tribeca-dinner-bra-top-tweed-suit-7511458.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
