Romeo knows he was lied to, he doesn’t like anybody but he is putting on his game face. Hai received a vote at tribal and now he is upset about it, he thinks it came from Romeo who said he was a God-fearing man and would never vote for him. Romeo will never tell, but it was him, he did it to make Hai squirm and freak out.</p><p>The next morning, the men look like they are going to go against Romeo. Rocksroy thinks the dudes should stick together, they have the numbers. He wants to make an alliance with five guys, Jonathan likes the idea, he is in because everyone is always after the big guys in Survivor. Mike likes it too, for the time being. Rockstoy goes to speak to Omar and tells him it is a good idea to do a guy’s alliance. Hai somehow became a part of it, but he doesn’t know if he would vote with them, he doesn’t like the way Rocksroy speaks to him.</p><p>Time for the immunity challenge. Today they are going to balance on a triangular platform in rough water with their feet perched on very narrow pieces of wood, at regular intervals they will move higher, making it harder. Two people will win immunity. They will break up into two teams of 5 and go to the tribal council as a team of 5, there goes the men’s alliance! In addition, the person that lasts the longest wins beef and veggie kabobs for their team to take back to camp and cook themselves. In addition, that team will go to the tribal council last, giving them more time to strategize and to see who gets voted out first.</p><p>Blue Team: Drea, Jonathan, Tori, Lindsey, Maryanne. Orange Team: Mike, Rocksroy, Romeo, Omar, and Hai. The sea is really rough and the wind is picking up, this could be a fast game. They start dropping like flies, one by one, the water is really rough. It is down to Lindsey, Hai, and Jonathan. Lindsey falls over, and so does Hai. Jonathan wins the food for this team. Both Hai and Jonathan win immunity.</p><p>Omar says going into the tribal council Romeo is a dead man walking, but he can trust him, so he is conflicted. Omar and Hai talk about blindsiding Rocksroy. Hai is ok with it, but he wants to tell Mike because he doesn’t want to lose his trust. Hai goes to Mike, he tells him that Rocksroy should go instead of Romeo. Mike says no, then they go against his alliance and break their word. Mike gave his word and he is not going to break it. Meanwhile, Jonathan and the winners on his team are enjoying the food. Jonathan has been waiting to make a big move and this is it. He wants to fish out Drea’s idol. She is fine with getting rid of Drea, but he is getting under her skin because he treats her like a little girl.</p><p>Jonathan speaks to Drea, and he tells her to vote for Maryanne, he wants to flush out her idol. That’s a red flag for Drea because she has an idol too. Lindsey doesn’t think Jonathan is thinking clearly, if Drea plays her idol, Maryanne will go home, so she doesn’t like the plan. She says being the only man, he feels like a top dog and he is not listening. Lindsey wants Tori out, that way Drea and Maryanne have their idols and they have power.</p><p>The first tribal council begins. Hai is shivering, it is raining outside and he says it sucks. Mike says you wake up with plan A and then you get plan B. Romeo says they knew what they wanted to do at tribal, but they all have to adapt. Mike says they didn’t scatter today, so maybe this tribal is a game of chicken. Rocksroy says they just acted like guys today. Time to vote. No immunity idols or advantages played. One vote for Romeo, then Rocksroy, Rocksroy, Rocksroy. That is it, Rocksroy was voted out. Rocksroy says Hai and Romeo did this, he hopes they freeze.</p><p>The next team comes out and Jonathan is shocked. Drea says she doesn’t understand what it means to see Rocksroy sitting on the jury bench. Drea says it is always the black contestants who get booted out and this is what this is. Jeff asks her if she thinks this is race-related. She says she just sees that she has to play the game differently, she is playing her idol. Maryanne says she cannot write down Drea’s name, she is not going to send another black player out.</p><p>Jonathan says he doesn’t think this is right because they are acting like they are racist. Jeff says if he hears her right, she is stepping outside the game to do what she thinks is right. Jonathan is glad that it is not the tribe that made them feel that way because he loves them. Drea and Maryanne turn in their idols, and neither is going home. It comes down to Lindsey or Tori, so Tori wants to play her shot in the dark. Tori is not safe and she is voted out.</p><p>THE END!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmdoaKpxq2t1Kebq7FemLyue5FpaWtno6q%2Ft7XVqKlmqpWYrrF5j21ka29dZ39uv8SaqqimXWl%2FbrHPoqqonJVihm6zwKacZqeWYrCptcKknKdn</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsurvivor-recap-04-27-22-season-42-episode-9-game-of-chicken.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fsurvivor-recap-04-27-22-season-42-episode-9-game-of-chicken.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fsurvivor-recap-04-27-22-season-42-episode-9-game-of-chicken.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fsurvivor-recap-04-27-22-season-42-episode-9-game-of-chicken.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsurvivor-recap-04-27-22-season-42-episode-9-game-of-chicken.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsurvivor-recap-04-27-22-season-42-episode-9-game-of-chicken.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./graham-norton-reveals-guests-most-outrageous-requests.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./graham-norton-reveals-guests-most-outrageous-requests.html>Graham Norton reveals A-list guest's most outrageous request</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./khloe-kardashian-regrets-getting-a-tramp-stamp-2009211.html>Khloe Kardashian Regrets Getting a &amp;quot;Tramp Stamp&amp;quot;</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./khloe-kardashian-regrets-getting-a-tramp-stamp-2009211.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
