We’re not saying we’re supermodels. I’d rather people look at us as business people, and, yes, modeling is our business right now, but we’re not trying to take anybody’s spot, and we’re not trying to discredit the past.”</p><p>“Everybody literally thinks I’ve had plastic surgery. My mom’s family calls her, and they’re like, ‘Did Hailey do her lips? Did she do her nose?’ Do people want me to go to a doctor and have them examine my face so they can tell people I haven’t? My face has just matured. I grew into my looks.”</p><p>“My style kind of differs – sometimes I want to be a little dressed down, a little tomboy, sometimes I want to be dressed up and very chic and look proper. But I don’t ever believe in overdoing it for day-to-day style.”</p><p>“All my tattoos except my first were not planned. I would just go into the shop late at night with friends and ask for something on the spot. My first is my parents’ wedding date. I thought it would soften the blow of getting a tattoo.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwtr7RnqWtZZ%2Bjuaq6xGeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2xX52uqrjEsmSboZWXsrN5zZ6rZq%2Bfp8GpeZFpaWtnYmd9dn2O</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhailey-bieber-net-worth-2022.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fhailey-bieber-net-worth-2022.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fhailey-bieber-net-worth-2022.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fhailey-bieber-net-worth-2022.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhailey-bieber-net-worth-2022.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhailey-bieber-net-worth-2022.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./does-billie-eilish-have-a-boyfriend.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./does-billie-eilish-have-a-boyfriend.html>Does Billie Eilish Have a Boyfriend?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./brian-patrick-wade-tv-actor-net-worth-265409.html>Brian Patrick Wade Net Worth 2024</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./brian-patrick-wade-tv-actor-net-worth-265409.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
