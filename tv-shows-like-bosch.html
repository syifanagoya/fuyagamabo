<time>03 Feb 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Drama about a good cop TV shows are excellent time fillers, and once you’ve been addicted to them, it’s difficult to avoid binge-watching them. ‘Bosch,’ for example, is a fantastic cop drama series that is based on Michael Connelly’s acclaimed books and does a fantastic job of honoring the source material. We’re not always sure if TV shows can elicit the same emotions as the books they’re based on, but what ‘Bosch’ manages to depict is completely strange and unfolds precisely as you envisioned while reading the book. Even if you aren’t much of a reader and haven’t read the original books, this series will keep you awake at night with its nerve-wracking suspense and puzzles. This jazz-themed performance is one of the best in the genre, and the only problem is that, like all good things in life, it must come to an end at some point.</p><p>Like most great badass cops, Harry Bosch (Titus Welliver), the protagonist of this drama, has significant authority issues and throws himself into serious difficulties when he murders a cold-blooded serial killer. But following his instincts and breaking a few laws along the way has helped him to grow into the man he is today, with the top case-solving rate in the state of California. While Bosch is awaiting a federal trial for killing a serial killer, he comes across the case of a 13-year-old boy’s murder, which may be the most difficult case he has ever had to solve.</p><p>Titus Welliver, who plays the major role with a gloomy tone, does an excellent job of portraying the man depicted in the books. This isn’t your run-of-the-mill cop drama, and you’ll be astonished at how excellent it is. If you’ve finished watching ‘Bosch,’ you’re undoubtedly suffering from the after-binge-viewing blues. That’s the real deal now. As a result, we’ve compiled a list of the finest shows that are comparable to ‘Bosch.’ Several of these shows, such as ‘Bosch,’ are available on Netflix, Hulu, or Amazon Prime.</p><p class=toc_title>Table Of Content</p><ul class=toc_list><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">1</span> Broadchurch (2013)</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">2</span> Dexter (2006)</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">3</span> Fargo (2014)</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">4</span> Hannibal (2013)</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">5</span> Luther (2010)</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">6</span> Ray Donovan (2013)</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">7</span> The Bridge (2013)</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">8</span> The Fall (2013)</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">9</span> The Killing (2011)</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">10</span> The Wire (2002)</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">11</span> True Detective (2014)</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">12</span> Terriers (2010)</a></li></ul><h3><span id=Broadchurch_2013>Broadchurch (2013)</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Broadchurch-2.jpg alt="bosch spin off,shows like bosch reddit,bosch tv series,is bosch on netflix or amazon prime,new bosch series release date,bosch season 8,detective shows on amazon prime,bosch legacy,bosch spin-off,tv shows like bosch,tv shows like bosch on amazon prime,tv shows like bosch (tv series),good tv shows like bosch,similar tv shows like bosch,best tv shows like bosch,best netflix series like bosch,other tv shows like bosch,detective tv shows like bosch" width=1024 height=576 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br>When the murder of an 11-year-old kid shatters the quiet and welcoming coastal village of Broadchurch, everything appears to be perfectly fine.
