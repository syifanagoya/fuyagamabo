Boyle got a recording deal with Simon Cowell’s Syco Entertainment company despite coming in second.</strong></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/superstarsculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Untitled-design-1.jpg alt="Easy way to win money online (1)" width=550 height=100 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><strong>Boyle’s debut album, I Dreamed a Dream, broke records for debut albums’ largest first-week sales and became the best-selling debut album of all time in the UK. In 2010, her second album, The Gift, twice topped the charts in the US and the UK. She has so far published eight studio albums; the most recent, Ten, will be available in 2019</strong>.</p><h2>What Is Susan Boyle Doing Now?</h2><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/superstarsculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Untitled-design-1.jpg alt="Easy way to win money online (1)" width=550 height=100 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>After being isolated for months owing to the coronavirus, Susan is delighted to be back on stage.</p><p>In the first few weeks of <strong>March 2020</strong>, Susan finished her Ten tours and then withdrew into isolation as the coronavirus swept the globe. Type-2 diabetes increased Susan’s risk of contracting the deadly illness, so she accepted recommendations to isolate herself.</p><p>Boyle, meanwhile, has no immediate intentions to retire. She wants to continue singing far into her eighties, much like her idol Elaine Paige. Boyle amused the audience during her infamous BGT audition by saying that she aspired to be like Paige. Few people took her seriously, but as soon as the first notes started coming out of her mouth, everyone knew Elaine was going places.</p><p><span style=font-size:18pt>Also Read: <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Why Ed Skrein Left Game Of Thrones And His Family Life</a></span></p><p>Elaine told The Sun,</p><p><strong>“I love what I do and want to keep doing it so long as the audience appreciates it. “I’m going to cling to what I do for dear life. I haven’t had much time to work. But I’m always an optimist, so that will change eventually.”</strong></p><p>Susan struggled with loneliness just as much as anyone else did. “Everyone has been in the same boat,” Susan continued. “I’ve had days when I’ve felt sad or trapped in a rut, or bored or staring at the same four walls. Susan underwent a vaccination in March 2021, which was a significant step toward her comeback to the stage. On Instagram, she wrote:</p><p><strong>“Monday gave me the impression that there was finally hope at the end of the dark tunnel. Although there is a lot of misinformation floating around regarding the vaccination, I urge you to go out and get it as soon as it becomes available. I’m thankful for science, medicine, and in particular for the excellent NHS staff members who work as nurses and doctors.</strong></p><p>Uncertainty surrounds Susan’s return’s specifics. She was reportedly aiming to play in the US in November, according to a source who spoke to The Sun. The insider went on to say that Boyle has been approached by the organizers about appearing in several shows in Las Vegas in late 2021.</p><p>Susan is really happy to have been asked, and if she can, she plans to travel to the US in November to perform. She has been hiding out in Scotland throughout the pandemic, but she is eager to resume her singing career. She enjoys her job, but she might be tempted by some sequins.</p><p>Although Susan’s anticipated tour was canceled, we still anticipate her return. Susan continues to reside in her West Lothian, Scotland, family home despite her significant riches.</p><p>Susan Boyle had lost her mother two years before her BGT audition. After the defeat, she felt helpless and devastated, but she subsequently said that a type of divine intervention involving her mother had propelled her forward during the competition. Susan added, “I’m confident there was spiritual intervention involved.”</p><p>After she finished in second place on BGT, Boyle secretly panicked. She told The Metro, “I didn’t want to go back to my former life.” The panic eventually gave way to tiredness when Simon [Cowell] rushed onto the platform and whispered into my ear that I had a recording contract regardless of what.</p><p>Susan immediately put her BGT setback behind her and produced three chart-topping albums in only three years. Boyle needed some time to adjust to his overnight celebrity. The rapid popularity, Boyle said,</p><p><strong>“It was probably the biggest difference, going from being a small unknown girl with a cat in Scotland to being recognized wherever I went.” It required some adjusting.”</strong></p><p>Boyle’s net worth increased dramatically when her albums broke sales records, reaching millions. She refused to live her life, however, as most famous people do, and remained modest and grounded. She continues to reside in the house her parents built in Blackburn, West Lothian, Scotland.</p><p>Susan told The Sun, 4</p><p><strong>“It’s lovely to be in your mom’s house as well, there are a lot of nice memories in my mom’s.” “I feel like she’s here in some way,” she said. Susan doesn’t live in a home with a roommate. For the past seven years, she has been single.”</strong></p><p>Boyle famously admitted in <strong>2009</strong> that she had never been kissed. During the US leg of her <strong>2014</strong> Susan Boyle in Concert tour, she met her first partner, a Connecticut doctor. The two were going to move in together in Scotland after meeting in Clearwater, Florida.</p><p>Boyle told The Sun,</p><p><strong>“I hope he comes over. We are about the same age, and he was a very lovely guy, is all I’ll say. Sadly, the union did not last, and Susan has been alone ever since.</strong></p><p><span style=font-size:18pt>Also Read: <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Has Shaun Robinson Got Remarried</a></span></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/superstarsculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Untitled-design-1.jpg alt="Easy way to win money online (1)" width=550 height=100 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Singer</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><a href=# rel=prev><span>Previous Article</span><p>What is Dane Cook Doing Now?</p></a><a href=# rel=next><span>Next Article</span><p>Where Is Michelle Ryan In 2022?</p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpaWys7%2FTmqmsm6Whwba%2BxGeaqKVfrLWiwIyiqmarpaiur3nBqLClnV2ZvKq6xmalqK9f</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-is-susan-boyle-doing-now.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-is-susan-boyle-doing-now.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-is-susan-boyle-doing-now.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-is-susan-boyle-doing-now.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-is-susan-boyle-doing-now.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-is-susan-boyle-doing-now.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./teresa-terry.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./teresa-terry.html>Who is Todd Chrisleys Ex-Husband Teresa terry?
