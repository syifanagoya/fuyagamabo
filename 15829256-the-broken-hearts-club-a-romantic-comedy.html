Of course, it's entire budget was something like $1 million, so it wasn't a big risk, financially.</p><p>It was still unusual for name actors to take gay parts when this movie came out in 2000. So, Dean Cain was certainly taking a big risk playing the part. But Cain also hadn't gotten many parts since Lois and Clark ended, so it was a way to shake up his career.</p><p>John Mahoney was old enough that the part wouldn't hurt his career.</p><p>The others were up and coming.

I remember being unimpressed when it was released. Watching it today, I was surprised because I don't think it is too different from how a TV or feature film drama today would depict a group of gay men in Weho. The real clunker was Billy Porter's completely over the top portrayal of a gay stereotype. Made worse by him being the only black man in the cast. Not Porter's fault -- he's a talented actor and I believe he played the part as written. But yeah, I think it suffered because none of the actors came across as authentic.
